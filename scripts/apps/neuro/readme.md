# Neural Networks

Exploring the inner workings of the 3 main types of neural networks (Feed Forward, Recurrent, Convolutional)

## General Components

The neural network engine is broken up into different abstraction layers (not to be confused with Neural Network Layers),
and are largely modeled after a backend stack

- App
- Model Setup
- Event Listeners
- Interaction/Events Layer
- Presentation Layer

## Feed Forward

Uses a basic XOR example that converts 2 inputs into a single output with the XOR boolean logical operation to it.
This is a really good "first example" if you're new or learning the nuts/bolts of neural networks. It can be used
for any basic classificiation

## Recurrent

Language models, etc - Coming soon

## Convolutional

Image classification - Coming soon
