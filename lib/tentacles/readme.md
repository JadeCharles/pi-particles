# Tentacles (Inverse Kinematics)

Messing around with the "physics" behind IK. And also to use for web visual effects

## General Components

- Tentacle Agent: The mothership of the tentacles. A "body" if you will
- Tentacle: The compound arm, like an octopus
- Tentacle Segment: Sub components of a tentacle
- Tentacle Tip: The two tips of a segment. They contain the physics info (insofar as phyiscs concepts are actually used)
